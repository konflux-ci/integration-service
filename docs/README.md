## Creating or editing Mermaid diagrams

Mermaid is a JS based diagramming tool that renders markdown style syntax to create/modify diagrams. Mermaid has [native support in Github](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/372)

## Editing Diagrams
- Diagrams are stored in the `/docs` folder in the repository. As changes are made to the behaviour of controllers, these changes should also be updated in the diagram. 
- The updated mermaid diagram can be submitted as part of a separate PR or part of the PR that changes the behaviour of the controller. 
- To view diagram in Vscode: right click on file and select ‘open preview’ after the  [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid) has been installed (restart required)
- Diagrams can also be created/edited online, live editing is available at [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/edit). Copy and paste the diagram code into the live editor and view changes in real time.
