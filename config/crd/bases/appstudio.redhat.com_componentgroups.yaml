          ComponentGroup is the Schema for the componentgroups API.
          ComponentGroup serves as the replacement for the Application CR in the new application/component model.
          It groups Components together for testing and releasing, supports test serialization,
          ComponentGroup dependencies, and tracks the Global Candidate List (GCL) for each Component.
